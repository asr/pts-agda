Pure Type Systems (PTS)
=======================

This project contains a partial formalization of Pure Type Systems
(PTS), written in [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda).

The code makes heavy use of the Agda standard library, which is freely
available [here](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/).  It has been
tested using Agda 2.5.3 and version 0.14 of the Agda standard library.

For an excellent introduction to pure type systems, see
H. P. Barendregt's *Lambda Calculi with Types*, chapter 2 of the
Handbook of Logic in Computer Science (vol. 2), Oxford University
Press, 1992.
